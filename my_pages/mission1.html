  <h2> ABOUT  ICAMME - 2019 </h2>
 <p>The <strong>International Conference on Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering</strong> (<strong>ICAMME</strong> &#8211;<strong>2019</strong>) aims to provide an ideal platform and bring together the researchers, scientists, engineers, industrial experts, scholars and students share and widen their knowledge on theoretical, numerical and experimental developments in the field of manufacturing, production engineering, machine design, fluid/thermal engineering, and materials. This conference offers excellent opportunities for the participants to have a direct exchange of ideas and experiences, to mine potential research problems, to forge research relations alongside finding partners for future collaborations. The conference has invited eminent speakers from industry and academia for delivering keynote-lectures and plenary-talks. Given the gamut of engineering challenges pertaining to mechanical engineering and materials that the modern society is currently faced with, a holistic effort involving and transcending various disciplines of mechanical engineering is essential. Therefore, the <strong>ICAMME</strong>&#8211;<strong>2019</strong> aims at emphasizing the need of the channelization of research efforts from various streams of mechanical engineering for bringing technological advancements addressing and providing solutions to key engineering issues.</p>
<p>The conference program includes plenary talks and keynote lectures from eminent speakers from industry and academia alongside paper presentations in parallel sessions. Papers are invited on the following topics to be addressed (but not limited to) in accordance with the theme of the conference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Topic : Smart and Advanced Materials</li>
<li>Topic: Advanced Manufacturing</li>
<li>Topic : Design and Industrial Engineering</li>
<li>Topic: Thermal and fluid Engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>All submitted papers will be evaluated by the conference reviewer committee in terms of quality, originality of approach and relevance to the theme of the conference. The paper should be an original contribution, not published/accepted/under consideration or presented anywhere else earlier.</p>
